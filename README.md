# Capstone Proposal

## Project Title: USafe 

Group Members:

- Nada Almutairi
- Refal Alboqami
- Dalal Alharbi

### Main Objective:

The main objective of the USafe project is to develop a device capable of detecting cases of fainting using a camera and alerting the surrounding individuals by triggering an alarm bell.

### Subobjectives:

- Develop a deep learning model for automatic detection of fainting cases by analyzing the video stream from the camera.
- Improve the accuracy of fainting detection by training the model on a wide range of possible fainting scenarios.
- Design and develop an alarm bell activation system that is automatically triggered upon detecting a fainting case.
- Test and evaluate the performance of the system using a diverse set of data and scenarios.


Dataset Link:
Note: you have to choose a real dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
